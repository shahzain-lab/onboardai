# ✍️ Git Commit Message Best Practices

We follow **Conventional Commits** to keep commit history clean and meaningful.

---

## ✅ Format
`<type>(optional scope): <short summary>`

---

## ✅ Examples
 - feat(frontend): add onboarding dashboard
 - fix(backend): resolve token validation bug
 - docs: update API usage instructions
 - chore: upgrade dependencies
 - refactor(agent): improve orchestration logic
---

## ✅ Types
- **feat** → a new feature  
- **fix** → a bug fix  
- **docs** → documentation changes only  
- **style** → formatting, no code logic changes (e.g. lint fixes)  
- **refactor** → code change that doesn’t add a feature or fix a bug  
- **test** → adding or fixing tests  
- **chore** → maintenance tasks (dependencies, configs, CI/CD)  

---

## 🔍 Additional Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused (one feature or fix per PR).  
- Write clear PR titles and descriptions.  
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting.  
- Be respectful and collaborative in discussions.
